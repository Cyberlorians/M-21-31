# M2131 Project Overview

The **M2131 Project** is a comprehensive initiative aimed at significantly enhancing the cybersecurity capabilities of U.S. Federal agencies. Aligned with **Executive Order 14028**, the project addresses the urgent need for improved cybersecurity practices and compliance across the federal landscape.

## Core Objectives

### 🔍 Enhancing Visibility
The project focuses on improving visibility **before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident** by establishing centralized access for each agency’s Security Operations Center (SOC). This enables more responsive, coordinated, and effective incident response.

### 📊 Event Logging Maturity Model
To drive consistent progress, M2131 defines a structured maturity model for event logging. The model aligns with the timelines outlined in OMB M-21-31:

#### Key Timelines:

- **Within 60 Days (October 26, 2021):**  
  Agencies should evaluate their maturity against the model and identify implementation gaps.

- **Within 1 Year (August 27, 2022):**  
  Agencies must achieve **Event Logging Tier 1 (EL1)** maturity.

- **Within 18 Months (February 27, 2023):**  
  Agencies should reach **EL2** maturity.

- **Within 2 Years (August 27, 2023):**  
  Agencies are expected to achieve **EL3** maturity.

Each tier represents a progressive level of logging capability:

- **EL1:** Basic logging capabilities operational  
- **EL2:** Enhanced logging for better data collection and analysis  
- **EL3:** Advanced logging supporting effective threat detection and mitigation

### 🗂️ Direct Mappings and Event Artifacts  
The project begins by identifying the **required data specified in the M-21-31 Executive Order**. From there, it creates structured mappings that align each requirement with specific workloads, tables, and schemas. These mappings then generate **event artifacts** that serve as the foundation for:

- Day-to-day security operations  
- Audit readiness and evidence collection  
- Ongoing compliance validation

This approach streamlines reporting processes and provides clear, traceable evidence for auditors, making it easier for agencies to demonstrate alignment with federal cybersecurity mandates.

### 🛡️ Comprehensive GRC and DFIR Tooling
The offering created through M2131 is designed to become a full-featured:

- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** tool  
- **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** platform

This toolset supports **CIOs, CISOs, SOC analysts, and auditors**, providing the functionality needed to manage compliance, investigate incidents, and strengthen cybersecurity frameworks.
