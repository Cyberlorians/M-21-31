# M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App

The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** is a comprehensive solution designed to strengthen the cybersecurity capabilities of U.S. Federal agencies. Aligned with **Executive Order 14028** and developed in response to **Executive Order M-21-31**, this new offering enables agencies to manage and mature their event logging capabilities, validate compliance, and enhance visibility before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident.

---

## Core Objectives

### 🔍 Improving Visibility  
The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** prioritizes visibility across the full incident lifecycle. By centralizing event logging data and implementation tracking, agencies gain clearer insights into log coverage and potential blind spots. This enables more **responsive, coordinated, and effective incident response**, while also supporting proactive threat mitigation.

---

### 📊 Event Logging Maturity Model  

M-21-31 introduces a maturity model to ensure consistent and structured improvement of logging practices across federal agencies. The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** is designed to help agencies assess, plan, and track their progress toward full compliance.

#### Event Logging Maturity Levels:
- **EL0 (Not Effective):** Logging requirements of highest criticality are not met or only partially met.  
- **EL1 (Basic):** Logging requirements of highest criticality are met.  
- **EL2 (Intermediate):** Logging requirements of highest and intermediate criticality are met.  
- **EL3 (Advanced):** Logging requirements across all criticality levels are fully met.

#### Key Timelines:
- **Within 60 Days (October 26, 2021):** Agencies evaluate their maturity and identify implementation gaps.  
- **Within 1 Year (August 27, 2022):** Achieve **EL1** maturity.  
- **Within 18 Months (February 27, 2023):** Reach **EL2** maturity.  
- **Within 2 Years (August 27, 2023):** Attain **EL3** maturity.

### 🗂️ Direct Mappings and Event Artifacts

The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** begins by identifying the **required data elements** outlined in the **M-21-31 Executive Order**. It then creates structured mappings that connect these requirements to specific **Microsoft workloads**, **Log Analytics tables**, and **data schemas**. These mappings help generate **event artifacts**—definable data points that are expected to be captured by an agency's logging infrastructure.

These artifacts form the foundation for:

- **Day-to-day security operations**  
- **Audit readiness and evidence collection**  
- **Ongoing compliance validation**

This approach ensures agencies have a clear understanding of what data is expected and where it should reside. While the app is optimized for **Microsoft technologies**, it offers the flexibility for users to manually track log data from **non-Microsoft environments**, allowing broader integration with hybrid systems and third-party platforms.

Importantly, while the app **tracks** whether the correct logs are configured and expected to be collected, **actual event validation happens within Microsoft Sentinel**, using the **Event Verification Workbook**. This separation ensures that tracking and forensic proof are handled in their appropriate systems.

### 🛡️ Comprehensive GRC and DFIR Tooling

The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** is more than just a compliance tracker. It functions as a full-featured:

- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** tool  
- **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** enabler

#### GRC Support:
- Enables agency leadership (CIOs, CISOs, auditors) to **monitor logging posture**
- Tracks **maturity progress** across EL0–EL3 tiers
- Offers an **audit-ready structure** for compliance with M-21-31

#### DFIR Support:
The app significantly enhances DFIR readiness by mapping what logs should exist, where they should be stored, and ensuring retention settings are in place. However, **event validation is performed within Microsoft Sentinel**, using the dedicated:

> 🔎 **Microsoft Sentinel Event Verification Workbook**  
> This workbook confirms that log events were successfully collected by Sentinel, using KQL queries and visualizations. It provides **forensic-level validation** that is essential for incident investigation, root cause analysis, and regulatory reporting.

Together, these tools deliver an end-to-end solution:

- The **App** provides **tracking, planning, and compliance mapping**  
- **Sentinel + Workbook** delivers **event proof, log validation, and forensic readiness**

This approach gives DFIR and SOC teams a single source of truth for what should be logged and where to go to prove it, enhancing both **incident response** and **evidence integrity**.
