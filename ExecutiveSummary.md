# M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App

The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** is a comprehensive solution aimed at strengthening the cybersecurity capabilities of U.S. Federal agencies, aligned with **Executive Order 14028**. This new offering was created to help agencies enhance their preparedness and compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The app offers a structured approach to improving event logging, enabling agencies to monitor, assess, and validate their progress in meeting the requirements outlined in **Executive Order M-21-31**.

## Core Objectives

### üîç Improving Visibility  
The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** is designed to prioritize enhancing visibility **before, during, and after** a cybersecurity incident. By providing centralized access for each agency‚Äôs **Security Operations Center (SOC)**, this app helps ensure that agencies can detect, investigate, and remediate cybersecurity incidents more effectively. This centralized approach enables **coordinated, responsive, and effective incident response**, giving SOC teams the necessary insights for proactive threat detection and mitigation.

### üìä Event Logging Maturity Model  
The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** is built around the **Event Logging Maturity Model**, which introduces four levels of event logging maturity. The app helps agencies track and achieve each level, progressively improving their event logging practices and ensuring that all required data is captured and retained.

#### Event Logging Maturity Levels:
- **EL0 (Not Effective):** Logging requirements of highest criticality are either not met or only partially met.  
- **EL1 (Basic):** Only logging requirements of highest criticality are met.  
- **EL2 (Intermediate):** Logging requirements of highest and intermediate criticality are met.  
- **EL3 (Advanced):** Logging requirements at all criticality levels are met.

#### Key Timelines:
- **Within 60 Days (October 26, 2021):** Agencies should evaluate their maturity against the model and identify implementation gaps.  
- **Within 1 Year (August 27, 2022):** Agencies must achieve **Event Logging Tier 1 (EL1)** maturity.  
- **Within 18 Months (February 27, 2023):** Agencies should reach **EL2** maturity.  
- **Within 2 Years (August 27, 2023):** Agencies are expected to achieve **EL3** maturity.

### üóÇÔ∏è Direct Mappings and Event Artifacts  
The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** begins by identifying the required data specified in the **Executive Order**. It creates structured mappings that align each requirement with specific **Microsoft** workloads, tables, and schemas. These mappings generate **event artifacts** that serve as the foundation for:

- Day-to-day security operations  
- Audit readiness and evidence collection  
- Ongoing compliance validation

While primarily designed for **Microsoft** products, the **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** offers flexibility for users to integrate data from outside the **Microsoft ecosystem**, enabling broader compatibility with other systems and technologies.

### üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive GRC and DFIR Tooling  
The **M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App** is designed to be a full-featured **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** tool as well as a **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** platform. This new app supports **CIOs, CISOs, SOC analysts, and auditors**, helping them manage compliance, investigate incidents, and strengthen cybersecurity frameworks in line with **M-21-31** requirements.

Additionally, the **Microsoft Sentinel Event Verification Workbook** can be leveraged with Microsoft Sentinel to **prove event logging**. This workbook provides an interactive solution to verify that events have been properly logged and are accessible for auditing, further supporting compliance with **M-21-31** guidelines.
