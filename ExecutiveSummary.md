The M2131 project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at significantly enhancing the cybersecurity capabilities of US Federal agencies. This project is aligned with Executive Order 14028, which emphasizes the urgent need for improved cybersecurity across federal agencies. The primary objectives of the M2131 project include:

1. **Enhancing Visibility**: The project aims to improve visibility before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident by establishing centralized access for each agencyâ€™s Security Operations Center (SOC). This sets a solid foundation for a more responsive and effective cybersecurity framework.

2. **Event Logging Maturity Levels**: The project outlines a maturity model for event logging, which includes:
   - **Within 1 Year**: Achieving Event Logging Tier 1 (EL1) maturity, ensuring basic logging capabilities are operational.
   - **Within 18 Months**: Reaching EL2 maturity, enhancing logging practices for improved data collection and analysis.
   - **Within 2 Years**: Attaining EL3 maturity, indicating a robust logging framework that supports effective incident response and threat mitigation.

3. **Direct Mappings and Event Artifacts**: The M2131 project has created direct mappings based on the requirements of M-21-31. These mappings provide event artifacts that are essential for agencies and their auditors. By leveraging these mappings, agencies can ensure compliance with the executive order and provide the necessary proof for audits.

4. **Continuous Improvement**: The tools and services provided under the M2131 project will be regularly updated to incorporate the latest advancements in cybersecurity and log management. This project was developed by employees in their free time, utilizing their expertise in their respective fields.

5. **Collaboration and Support**: The project fosters a collaborative environment, working alongside Federal agencies to address their unique challenges and requirements. Support teams will be available to provide ongoing assistance, ensuring a smooth and effective implementation of M-21-31 guidelines. The dedication and expertise of the employees involved have been instrumental in the project's success.

By leveraging cutting-edge technology and expertise, US Federal customers can confidently enhance their cybersecurity posture, ensuring compliance with M-21-31 and safeguarding their critical systems and data.
