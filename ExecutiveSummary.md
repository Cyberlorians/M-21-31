# M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App

The **M-21-31 Project** is a comprehensive initiative aimed at strengthening the cybersecurity capabilities of U.S. Federal agencies, aligned with **Executive Order 14028**. This initiative is designed to address critical cybersecurity challenges and improve agency preparedness across the federal landscape. **M-21-31** outlines the importance of improving visibility and preparedness before, during, and after cybersecurity incidents, ensuring that agencies have the tools needed to detect, respond to, and recover from threats effectively.

## Core Objectives

### üîç Improving Visibility  
The **M-21-31** project prioritizes enhancing visibility **before, during, and after** a cybersecurity incident by establishing centralized access for each agency‚Äôs **Security Operations Center (SOC)**. This centralized approach enables more **coordinated, responsive, and effective incident response**, providing the necessary insights for proactive threat detection and mitigation.

### üìä Event Logging Maturity Model  
The **M-21-31** Executive Order introduces a structured **Event Logging Maturity Model** to help agencies progressively improve their event logging capabilities. The model includes four key maturity levels, each building on the previous to ensure comprehensive event logging across various levels of criticality.

#### Event Logging Maturity Levels:

- **EL0 (Not Effective):** Logging requirements of highest criticality are either not met or only partially met.  
- **EL1 (Basic):** Only logging requirements of highest criticality are met.  
- **EL2 (Intermediate):** Logging requirements of highest and intermediate criticality are met.  
- **EL3 (Advanced):** Logging requirements at all criticality levels are met.

#### Key Timelines:
- **Within 60 Days (October 26, 2021):** Agencies should assess their maturity against the model and identify implementation gaps.  
- **Within 1 Year (August 27, 2022):** Agencies must achieve **Event Logging Tier 1 (EL1)** maturity.  
- **Within 18 Months (February 27, 2023):** Agencies should reach **EL2** maturity.  
- **Within 2 Years (August 27, 2023):** Agencies are expected to achieve **EL3** maturity.

### üóÇÔ∏è Direct Mappings and Event Artifacts  
The **M-21-31** project begins by identifying the required data specified in the **Executive Order**. It then creates structured mappings that align each requirement with specific **Microsoft** workloads, tables, and schemas. These mappings generate **event artifacts** that serve as the foundation for:

- Day-to-day security operations  
- Audit readiness and evidence collection  
- Ongoing compliance validation

While primarily designed for **Microsoft** products, the **PowerApp** solution also offers the flexibility for users to integrate data from outside the **Microsoft ecosystem**, enabling broader compatibility with other systems and technologies.

### üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive GRC and DFIR Tooling  
M-21-31 Maturity Model Management App aims to deliver a full-featured **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** tool, as well as a **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** platform. These tools support **CIOs, CISOs, SOC analysts, and auditors**, helping them manage compliance, investigate incidents, and bolster cybersecurity frameworks to align with **M-21-31** requirements.

## Guiding Principles

### üîÑ Continuous Improvement  
The tools and services offered under **M-21-31** are regularly updated to incorporate the latest advancements in:

- Cybersecurity best practices  
- Log management technologies  
- Federal compliance standards

Developed by dedicated professionals in their own time, **M-21-31** reflects a commitment to **national security** and continuous improvement in the cybersecurity space.

### ü§ù Collaboration and Support  
**M-21-31** promotes collaboration, working alongside federal agencies to address unique cybersecurity challenges. **Ongoing support** ensures that agencies have the assistance needed for smooth implementation of **M-21-31** guidelines.
