## Core Objectives

### 🔍 Enhancing Visibility
The project focuses on improving visibility **before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident** by establishing centralized access for each agency’s Security Operations Center (SOC). This enables more responsive, coordinated, and effective incident response.

### 📊 Event Logging Maturity Model
To drive consistent progress, M2131 defines a structured maturity model for event logging:

- **Within 1 Year — EL1:** Basic logging capabilities operational.  
- **Within 18 Months — EL2:** Enhanced logging for better data collection and analysis.  
- **Within 2 Years — EL3:** Advanced logging supporting effective threat detection and mitigation.

### 🗂️ Direct Mappings and Event Artifacts
The project includes **direct mappings aligned with M-21-31** requirements. These mappings generate **event artifacts** that are critical for:

- Day-to-day operations  
- Audit readiness  
- Compliance validation

This simplifies reporting and offers clear traceability for auditors.

### 🛡️ Comprehensive GRC and DFIR Tooling
The offering created through M2131 is designed to become a full-featured:

- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** tool  
- **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** platform

This toolset supports **CIOs, CISOs, SOC analysts, and auditors**, providing the functionality needed to manage compliance, investigate incidents, and strengthen cybersecurity frameworks.
