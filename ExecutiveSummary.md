The M2131 project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at significantly enhancing the cybersecurity capabilities of U.S. Federal agencies. This effort is closely aligned with Executive Order 14028, which underscores the urgent need for improved cybersecurity practices across federal entities.

Core Objectives
Enhancing Visibility:
The project focuses on improving visibility before, during, and after a cybersecurity incident by establishing centralized access for each agency’s Security Operations Center (SOC). This foundation enables more responsive, coordinated, and effective incident response.

Event Logging Maturity Model:
To support sustained cybersecurity improvements, the project defines a structured maturity model for event logging:

Within 1 Year – Achieve Event Logging Tier 1 (EL1): Basic logging capabilities operational.

Within 18 Months – Reach EL2: Enhanced logging for better data collection and analysis.

Within 2 Years – Attain EL3: Advanced logging supporting effective threat detection and mitigation.

Direct Mappings and Event Artifacts:
The M2131 project includes direct mappings aligned with M-21-31 requirements. These mappings produce actionable event artifacts essential for agency operations, audits, and compliance efforts, simplifying reporting and validation for auditors.

Comprehensive GRC and DFIR Tooling:
The offering developed through the M2131 initiative is designed to evolve into a full Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) solution. This robust toolset will support CIOs, CISOs, SOC analysts, and auditors, helping them manage compliance, investigate incidents, and strengthen their agency’s cybersecurity framework.

Guiding Principles
Continuous Improvement:
The tools and services under the M2131 project will be regularly updated to reflect the latest advancements in cybersecurity and log management. Built by dedicated employees using their personal time and deep expertise, the project is driven by a shared commitment to national cybersecurity.

Collaboration and Support:
M2131 fosters a collaborative environment, working alongside federal agencies to address unique operational challenges. Ongoing support will be available to ensure a smooth and successful implementation of M-21-31 guidelines.

By leveraging cutting-edge technology and deep expertise, U.S. Federal agencies can enhance their cybersecurity posture, ensure compliance with M-21-31, and better protect their critical systems and data.
