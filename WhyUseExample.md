## üöÄ Why The PowerApp & Workbook Changes the Game

Every agency has logs.  
The question most agencies cannot answer, however, is: **within those logs, are the right events being collected, parsed, and usable for detection, response, or compliance?**

This workbook is built to operationalize the M-21-31 event logging maturity model ‚Äî transforming vague guidance into concrete, query-driven validation of telemetry coverage. It enables security teams, auditors, and engineers to prove what‚Äôs really being logged, where it‚Äôs flowing, and whether it can be used for detection, response, and compliance.

This workbook solves that problem:

- üîé **Proof, not assumptions**: You‚Äôre not hoping logs are there ‚Äî you‚Äôre validating it with live queries.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Defender + Entra + Windows** all in one place ‚Äî mapped directly to real M-21-31 categories.  
- ü§ù **Bridges security and compliance**: SOC analysts and auditors can align on evidence-backed coverage, not just policy intent.  
- üéØ **Threat hunting ready**: The queries aren‚Äôt just for audits ‚Äî they can detect, investigate, and enrich real-world attacks.

Whether you're in the SOC, compliance, or infrastructure teams, this workbook gives you a shared, single lens to evaluate logging posture in a Zero Trust world ‚Äî ensuring everyone is on the same page.

## üìå Core Benefits

### ‚úÖ Direct Mapping to M-21-31 Logging Categories
Each workbook section aligns to a specific logging requirement from the M-21-31 memorandum. You‚Äôre not guessing ‚Äî you‚Äôre validating exactly what exists and where gaps remain.

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Telemetry Validation
Rather than relying on checklists or assumed configurations, this workbook uses live KQL queries against your Microsoft Defender and Sentinel data to prove whether essential log types are collected and queryable.

### ‚úÖ Broad Workload Coverage
Supports validation across:

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) ‚Äì Requirements mapped using Entra telemetry. OS-specific audit events to follow.  
- Entra ID (Azure AD) ‚Äì Fully mapped.  
- Windows Security Events ‚Äì Phase 1 released.  
- Linux Syslog (auditd/local3) ‚Äì Coming soon.  
- Third-party SaaS via Sentinel connectors ‚Äì On the roadmap.

### ‚úÖ Designed for Collaboration
Built for joint consumption across SOC teams, compliance officers, auditors, and infrastructure engineers ‚Äî this tool delivers a unified, defensible view of logging posture in a Zero Trust architecture.

## üéØ Use Case Example ‚Äì Identity: Entra ID User Creation

This example tracks account creation activity in Entra ID (`Add user` operations via the AuditLogs table).

### üìÇ Mapping Snapshot:
- **Category:** Identity & Credential Management  
- **Subcategory:** Account ‚Üí Account Creation  
- **Data Source:** Entra ID  
- **Table:** AuditLogs  
- **OperationName:** Add user  
- **Docs:**  
  - [How to Integrate Audit Logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-azure-monitor-logs)  
  - [Audit Log Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-audit-logs)

### üîê Why This Is Critical

#### üìã M-21-31 Compliance
- Satisfies event logging requirements around account provisioning.  
- Validates not just that logs exist ‚Äî but that they are parsed, structured, and queryable.

#### üõ° Identity Visibility
- Proves whether Entra is emitting logs for user creation ‚Äî essential for Zero Trust and insider threat mitigation.  
- Identifies the actor (admin, app, sync process) behind account creation ‚Äî with full attribution and status.

#### üîé Threat Hunting
- Enables analysts to pivot quickly on IPs, users, roles, or apps involved in account lifecycle events.  
- Supports chaining with role assignment and sign-in activity for threat investigation.

#### üî• DFIR Readiness
- In the event of a breach, provides rapid insight into shadow account creation activity.  
- Helps establish the intent and origin of the actor behind unauthorized provisioning.

## üîç Example Insight ‚Äì Who Created What (and From Where)

In the example below, we see both **user-based** and **application-based** application creation, whether it be MultiTenant or not:

### Why This Matters

Even when identity logs exist, many orgs **don‚Äôt analyze who actually made the change**, from where, and whether it was expected.

This workbook enables:

- ‚úÖ **Separation of human vs. app initiators**  
  Helps distinguish between normal provisioning (e.g., HR onboarding via app) vs. risky direct admin activity.

- üåê **IP Address Attribution**  
  Correlate suspicious changes to originating networks ‚Äî invaluable during investigations.

- üßæ **Multi-tenant Context Awareness**  
  Knowing whether changes occurred in your tenant or via delegated access to others (e.g., `MultiTenant == true`) helps prevent lateral exposure.

- üîê **Service Principal Targeting Visibility**  
  Identify if critical apps like `MTD_Sync` or `SentinelScout` are being modified and by whom.

## üß† Analyst Tip

Pair this identity-focused telemetry with workbook filters (UPN, IP, app name, tenant scope) to **quickly answer questions like**:

- Who created this account?  
- Was it done by a sync engine, delegated admin, or automation app?  
- Was it a cross-tenant action?  
- What IP did it come from?

This clarity is what transforms logs into **defensible security evidence** ‚Äî and turns M-21-31 compliance into **actionable operational awareness**.

### üß† Live Query Example (Workbook Embedded):

```kql
// Objective: Detects new user creation events in Entra ID and allows for targeted filtering by initiator or target UPN.
let TargetedUserUPNs = dynamic([]); // Example: ["user1@domain.com"]
let InitiatorUPNs = dynamic([]);    // Example: ["admin@domain.com"]
AuditLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where OperationName == "Add user"
| extend InitiatorInfo = todynamic(InitiatedBy)
| extend TargetInfo = todynamic(TargetResources)[0]
| extend
    Status = Result,
    FailureReason = tostring(ResultSignature),
    InitiatorType = case(
        tostring(InitiatorInfo.user.userPrincipalName) has_cs "Sync", "Sync Process",
        isnotempty(InitiatorInfo.user.userPrincipalName), "Interactive User",
        isnotempty(InitiatorInfo.app.displayName), "Application",
        "Other"
    ),
    Initiator = coalesce(
        tostring(InitiatorInfo.user.userPrincipalName),
        tostring(InitiatorInfo.app.displayName)
    ),
    InitiatorIpAddress = tostring(InitiatorInfo.user.ipAddress),
    TargetUserUPN = tostring(TargetInfo.userPrincipalName),
    TargetUserID = tostring(TargetInfo.id)
| where (array_length(TargetedUserUPNs) == 0 or TargetUserUPN in (TargetedUserUPNs))
| where (array_length(InitiatorUPNs) == 0 or Initiator in (InitiatorUPNs))
| distinct TimeGenerated, Status, FailureReason, InitiatorType, Initiator, InitiatorIpAddress, TargetUserUPN, TargetUserID
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
| take 50
```
