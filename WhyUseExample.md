## üöÄ Why This Workbook Changes the Game

Most agencies have logs. But most agencies **don't know if the right events are being collected, parsed, and usable** for detection, response, or compliance.

This workbook solves that problem:

- üîé **Proof, not assumptions**: You‚Äôre not hoping logs are there ‚Äî you‚Äôre validating it with live queries.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Defender + Entra + Windows** all in one place ‚Äî mapped to real M-21-31 categories.  
- ü§ù **Bridges security and compliance**: SOC analysts and auditors can align on evidence-backed coverage, not just policy intent.  
- üéØ **Threat hunting ready**: The queries aren‚Äôt just for audits ‚Äî they can detect, investigate, and enrich real-world attacks.

## üìå Core Benefits

### ‚úÖ Direct Mapping to M-21-31 Logging Categories
Each workbook section maps to a specific logging requirement from the M-21-31 memorandum. You‚Äôre not guessing ‚Äî you‚Äôre validating what exists and pinpointing gaps.

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Telemetry Validation
Rather than checklists or theoretical recommendations, this workbook uses live KQL queries against your Microsoft Defender and Sentinel data to confirm whether essential log types are being collected.

### ‚úÖ Broad Workload Coverage
Supports validation across:
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) - Mapped with Entra. OS Events to be released.
- Entra ID (Azure AD) - Mapped.  
- Windows Security Events - Phase 1 released.  
- Linux Syslog (auditd/local3) - To Be Released.  
- Third-party SaaS (via Sentinel connectors) - On Roadmap.  

### ‚úÖ Designed for Collaboration
Whether you're in the SOC, compliance, or infrastructure teams, this workbook gives you a shared, structured lens to evaluate logging posture in a Zero Trust world.

## üéØ Use Case Example ‚Äì Identity: Entra ID User Creation

This example tracks account creation activity in Entra ID (`Add user` operations via the AuditLogs table).

### üìÇ Mapping Snapshot:
- **Category:** Identity & Credential Management  
- **Subcategory:** Account ‚Üí Account Creation  
- **Data Source:** Entra ID  
- **Table:** AuditLogs  
- **OperationName:** Add user  
- **Docs:**  
  - [How to Integrate Audit Logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-azure-monitor-logs)  
  - [Audit Log Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-audit-logs)

---

### üîê Why This Is Critical

#### üõ° Identity Visibility
- Confirms whether Entra is emitting logs for user creation ‚Äî a must-have for both Zero Trust and insider threat mitigation.  
- Reveals which admin or app created the account and whether it succeeded or failed.

#### üîé Threat Hunting
- Enables rapid pivoting by IP, actor, or target account.  
- Can be chained with role assignments or sign-ins to investigate suspicious user lifecycles.

#### üî• DFIR Readiness
- During an incident, quickly determine if shadow accounts were created.  
- Establish intent and actor type (sync process vs. interactive user vs. app).

#### üìã M-21-31 Compliance
- Satisfies event logging requirements around account provisioning.  
- Validates not just that logs exist ‚Äî but that they are parsed and queryable.

## üîç Example Insight ‚Äì Who Created What (and From Where)

In the example below, we see both **user-based** and **application-based** application creation, whether it be MultiTenant or not:

### Why This Matters

Even when identity logs exist, many orgs **don‚Äôt analyze who actually made the change**, from where, and whether it was expected.

This workbook enables:

- ‚úÖ **Separation of human vs. app initiators**  
  Helps distinguish between normal provisioning (e.g., HR onboarding via app) vs. risky direct admin activity.

- üåê **IP Address Attribution**  
  Correlate suspicious changes to originating networks ‚Äî invaluable during investigations.

- üßæ **Multi-tenant Context Awareness**  
  Knowing whether changes occurred in your tenant or via delegated access to others (e.g., `MultiTenant == true`) helps prevent lateral exposure.

- üîê **Service Principal Targeting Visibility**  
  Identify if critical apps like `MTD_Sync` or `SentinelScout` are being modified and by whom.

---

## üß† Analyst Tip

Pair this identity-focused telemetry with workbook filters (UPN, IP, app name, tenant scope) to **quickly answer questions like**:

- Who created this account?  
- Was it done by a sync engine, delegated admin, or automation app?  
- Was it a cross-tenant action?  
- What IP did it come from?

This clarity is what transforms logs into **defensible security evidence** ‚Äî and turns M-21-31 compliance into **actionable operational awareness**.

### üß† Live Query Example (Workbook Embedded):

```kql
// Objective: Detects new user creation events in Entra ID and allows for targeted filtering by initiator or target UPN.
let TargetedUserUPNs = dynamic([]); // Example: ["user1@domain.com"]
let InitiatorUPNs = dynamic([]);    // Example: ["admin@domain.com"]
AuditLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where OperationName == "Add user"
| extend InitiatorInfo = todynamic(InitiatedBy)
| extend TargetInfo = todynamic(TargetResources)[0]
| extend
    Status = Result,
    FailureReason = tostring(ResultSignature),
    InitiatorType = case(
        tostring(InitiatorInfo.user.userPrincipalName) has_cs "Sync", "Sync Process",
        isnotempty(InitiatorInfo.user.userPrincipalName), "Interactive User",
        isnotempty(InitiatorInfo.app.displayName), "Application",
        "Other"
    ),
    Initiator = coalesce(
        tostring(InitiatorInfo.user.userPrincipalName),
        tostring(InitiatorInfo.app.displayName)
    ),
    InitiatorIpAddress = tostring(InitiatorInfo.user.ipAddress),
    TargetUserUPN = tostring(TargetInfo.userPrincipalName),
    TargetUserID = tostring(TargetInfo.id)
| where (array_length(TargetedUserUPNs) == 0 or TargetUserUPN in (TargetedUserUPNs))
| where (array_length(InitiatorUPNs) == 0 or Initiator in (InitiatorUPNs))
| distinct TimeGenerated, Status, FailureReason, InitiatorType, Initiator, InitiatorIpAddress, TargetUserUPN, TargetUserID
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
| take 50
```

üß† Bottom Line
This isn‚Äôt just a compliance workbook.

It‚Äôs a defender-focused, auditor-ready, zero trust-aligned operational tool that proves your logs are real, structured, and useful ‚Äî not just "enabled."

Use this workbook to:

‚úÖ Validate your M-21-31 logging maturity

üö´ Detect gaps before auditors or attackers do

ü§ù Bring together technical teams and policy owners

If you have Entra, Windows, Defender, etc. ‚Äî this workbook is your new control panel.
