### üßæ Event Logging Form

This is the main data-entry interface where users define and track logging requirements for specific workloads. It captures mapping details required by the M-21-31 Executive Order.

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CriticalityID**   | Mapping identifier based on log importance/urgency.                                              |
| **Function**        | Corresponds to M-21-31 logging functions as outlined in the official guidance.                   |
| **Category**        | Logical grouping of logging requirements.                                                        |
| **Sub-Category**    | Further refinement of the category to pinpoint scope.                                            |

| **Workload**        | Specifies which Microsoft service or technology is responsible for generating the log.          |
| **Table**           | The Log Analytics Workspace table where the data is collected.                                   |
| **Schema**          | Structure of the expected data within the selected table.                                        |
| **Schema Value**    | The specific log field to be validated.                                                          |
| **IsCollected**     | Indicates if the table is actively being ingested (validated through Table Management view).     |
| **Event Validated** | Confirmed via the Event Queries tab and Microsoft Sentinel Workbook (if applicable).             |
